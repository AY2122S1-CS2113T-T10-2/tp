## 1. Introduction

**Welcome to TermiNUS!**

**TermiNUS** is a CLI (command line interface) program for NUS Students who wish to organize their
NUS academic materials through a CLI. The product aims to aid student in organizing their academic
schedule and enhancing their learning experiences.

**TermiNUS** is written in **Java 11** and uses the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm which
provides us with means to structure a software program into organized and reusable pieces of codes,
making it more efficient for future improvements and revisions.

### 1.1 Purpose

This developer guide is for any developers who wish to contribute to **TermiNUS**. It contains the
overall architecture design of **TermiNUS** and it displays our main features implementation details
with the rationale and consideration for each. As of now, the guide is written for the current
release version of `TermiNUS of v1.0`.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

### 3.2 UI Component

### 3.3 Parser Component

![](attachments/ParserClassDiagram.png)

The CommandParser Component consist the the `CommandParser` and multiple `XYZCommandParser`, each
representing a specific type command parser. The `CommandParser` will receive a command in
`parseCommand` function and check the according `HashMap<String, Command>` before returning the
according `Command` object back.

The `CommandParser` implements the following functionality:

- parsing the command string and giving the respective `Command` object
- Keeps track of the workspace
- Provides functionality to list all commands for the help `Command`

### 3.4 Command Component

![](attachments/CommandClassDiagram.png)

The Command Component `Command` class, `CommandResult` class and multiple `XYZCommand`
each representing a specific type of command. Each `Command` will `parseArguments` and set them to
private variables, and then `execute` would run specific operation specified by `XYZCommand`.
The `Command` would then modify the required changes in `ModuleManager` and print the required to be
output to `Ui` before returning a `CommandResult`.

The `CommandResult` will contains certain attributes to indicate if the `Terminus` loop should be
terminated or if the `CommandParser` might require changing through the `additionData` attribute.
The `CommandParser` maybe used to change workspace.

### 3.5 Module Component

![](attachments/Module.png)

The Module Components consists of the `ModuleManager` which contains a collection of `NusModule` and
maps a module name to a specific `NusModule`. The `NusModule` consist of `ContentManager` which help
to manage `Content`. The `ContentManager` accepts a `Content` type generic which is from the Content
Component

The `ModuleManager` implements the below functionality:

- add, delete or retrieve a specific `NusModule`
- list all module names
- grants access to the different types of content stored by `NusModule`

### 3.6 Content Component

![](attachments/Content.png)

The Content Component consist of objects such as `Link`, `Question` and `Note`
which inherit from the abstract `Content` class. The `ContentManager` allows a generic
`<T extends Content>` which must belong to the `Content` type or its children. The
`ContentManager` manages an `ArrayList` of Content type and provide the following functionality:

- adding of any Content type
- removing any Content
- accessing the Content and the inner data attribute
- getting the total number of content
- listing all contents
- accessing the arraylist of contents

### 3.7 Active Recall Component

![Active Recall Class Diagram](attachments/ActiveRecallClassDiagram.png)

The Active Recall Component consists of the `GameEnvironment` as the centre of the design.
The `GameEnvironment` consists of a `QuestionGenerator` which will only exist if there is a
`GameEnvironment`, and a `Ui` instance to handle user input and printing of information. The
decision to re-use the `Ui` is to allow easier upgrades to the `Ui` if there is a need in the
future. The `QuestionGenerator` takes in a list of `Question` and a maximum question count to
randomly generate questions based on `Random`. If `Random` is not provided, a new `Random` with a
random seed will be created to generate the `Question` order.  
The `DifficultyModifier` is a utility class used to calculate and tweak the weights of `Question`
after the user has provided feedback on the difficulty of the question. It uses a
[logistic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) to calculate the change in weight.

For further details on the implementation, head to
[4.2 Active Recall Implementation](#42-active-recall-implementation).

### 3.8 Storage Component

![](attachments/StorageComponent.png)

The Module Storage handles any file I/O operations of TermiNUS.

The `ModuleStorage` component:

- can create folder for each module provided by the user.
- can save modules, schedules and links data in a `.json` file.
- can save notes into multiple `.txt` files.

`TermiNUS` saved these data as either a `.json` or `.txt` file so users will be able to edit saved
data easily with any available text editor.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Timetable

The `timetable` feature is one of TermiNUS' features which can be accessed from the main workspace.

The `timetable` feature has 2 variations:

- **Daily** Timetable
- **Weekly** timetable.

The following sequence diagram shows how the timetable operation works:
![](attachments/Timetable.png)

The **Daily** and **Weekly** `timetable` feature differs by a user argument which is parsed as
the `day`.

The **Daily** `timetable` feature works by iterating through a collection of `NusModule` which are
stored inside a `ModuleManager`. Within the `NusModule`, the `ContentManager`, which stores all
the `Link` is accessed. All the `Link` inside `ContentManager` is iterated through to acquire all
the schedule which has the same attribute `day` as the user argument.

The **Weekly** `timetable` feature is an extension of the **Daily** `timetable` feature. It is
implemented by iterating through a `DaysOfWeekEnum` and acquires the **daily** `timetable` for each
day in the week.

### 4.2 Active Recall Implementation

![Active Recall Sequence Diagram](attachments/ActiveRecallSequenceDiagram.png)

To view the high-level diagram, head to
[3.7 Active Recall Component](#37-active-recall-component).

When the user executes the `TestCommand`, the `GameEnvironment` will be created with the static
method `GameEnvironment.createNewEnvironment()`, where it will handle the creation of
`QuestionGenerator` as well.

The `QuestionGenerator` creates a `NavigableMap<Double, Question>` to store all the questions, where
the `Double` is the `question.getWeight() + total`, where total is the current sum of all the
weights currently in the bank. The rationale for the `NavigableMap` and key value will be explained
at `promptQuestion()` below.

The newly created `GameEnvironment` will be returned to `TestCommand` where it would call the `run`
method within the object.

The `run()` method consists of 4 main steps (with step 2 to 4 repeating for every question):

1. `showPreGameInformation()`
2. `promptQuestion()`
3. `getUserFeedback()`
4. `updateQuestionDifficulty(question, difficulty)`

The `showPreGameInformation()` method will print the information once on the current Active Recall
session, such as the actual question pool size, and may include more information and statistics in
the future.

Next, the `run()` method will start a loop and check if there are questions in the local
`questionGenerator` to ensure that the session can continue. After which, the `promptQuestion()` is
called, where the next question is pulled from `questionGenerator.next()` and displayed to the user.

Within the `next()` method in the `QuestionGenerator`, it will find a random `double` number from
`0` to `total`, and look up a `Question` that is closest to the value. This was the reason for
using `NavigableMap` as it provides a method called `.higherEntry(key)`, which guarantees a
`Question` is returned provided the value never exceeds the total weight of the question pool (which
should never happen as the random number generator can only generate between `0` and `total`).

To prevent the user from viewing the answers before they are ready, we have decided to require the
user to press Enter to display the answer as a method of confirmation, as it is the most effective
way to ensure the answer does not get revealed unless the user intents to view it. The answer is
then displayed when the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key is hit, and the `promptQuestion()` passes the
`Question` asked back to the `run()` method.

The program now runs `getUserFeedback()` to collect user feedback. This is where we utilized the
same `Ui` class to handle the input of the user data for consistency and future-proofing, and return
the difficulty back to `run()` after cleaning the input. This is also when the user can decide if
they wish to quit the session, and if they do, the difficulty value will be set to `EXIT_CODE = -1`.

If the `difficulty` is checked to be the `EXIT_CODE`, the loop will break and return. Otherwise, the
`Question`'s difficulty will now be changed in the `updateQuestionDifficulty(question, difficulty)`
method, where we use the difference between the extremes and the current difficulty to apply into
the logistic curve to determine the amount to increase or decrease the weight of the randomness by.

The parameters of the logistic curve can be viewed here:
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qefovvnuhx.  
The input `x` value is the difference between the extreme and the current weight (e.g. if the weight
is `0.5` the extreme is the `MAX_VALUE = 0.9` when the question is deemed hard, then the difference
`x` will be `0.9 - 0.5 = 0.4`). The resultant `y` value is used to add or subtract the existing
weight if the question is deemed hard or easy to increase or decrease the chances of the questions
appearing respectively (e.g. using the same `x = 0.4` value, the `y` value will be `0.225` and it
will be added to `0.5` to form the new weight `0.725`).

The rationale behind using the logistic curve is to ensure that as harder questions appear more
often and easier questions appear less. We also want to ensure once the user finds a hard question
easy, it should quickly move down a difficulty and vice versa. The application of the logistic curve
also prevents the values from increasing too rapidly, and dominating the question pools. It also
prevents the case where easy questions disappear entirely from the question pool due to low weights.
We will continue to seek user feedback and tweak the curve parameters if needed if there are any
issues.

Once the adjustment of weights of the question is done, the process is repeated if there are
questions left inside `QuestionGenerator`. Otherwise, the Active Recall session will be terminated,
and the input will be passed back to the `CommandParser`.

### 4.5 Storage Implementation

To view the high-level diagram, head to
[3.8 Storage](#38-storage-component).

#### 4.5.1 Initialize Storage Implementation

![](attachments/StorageInitializeSequenceDiagram.png)

When `Terminus` just started, it will need to initialize a ModuleStorage object and loads any
related data from the `data` directory containing all previously saved data if any.

Firstly, `Terminus` will initialise an instance of `ModuleStorage` which is a singleton class
object. `Terminus` will then set the filepath of the `ModuleStorage` with the main `.json` file
filepath which contains data such as `module`, `questions` and `schedules`. `Terminus` do so by
calling the `init()` function provided by `ModuleStorage`.

Next, `Terminus` will proceed to load any data from the `data` directory by calling `loadFile()`
provided by `ModuleStorage`. Within the `ModuleStorage` method `loadFile()`, it will first check if
the main directory of `data` exists. This is because for first time execution of `Terminus`, there
should not be any `data` folder within the same folder in which `Terminus` was executed from. Hence,
if no `data` directory was found, it will create a `data` directory and create the main `.json`
file as well. However, if `data` directory exists, it will locate the main `.json` file within
the `data` directory. This main `.json` file is very important in telling `Terminus` what `modules`
does it have before this current execution of `Terminus`.

After which, the main `.json` contents will be loaded into `ModuleManager` by using
plugin `GsonBuilder`. This `ModuleManager` will then be used throughout the execution of `Terminus`.
For more information, please refer to ModuleManager Section.

Next, `ModuleStorage` will proceed to load any note data from the `modules` stated within
the `ModuleManager` object. Firstly, due to the restriction of `Terminus workspace`, it will filter
out any `modules` whose name does not fit the criteria of a valid `module` name. Subsequently, it
will check if the `module` has an existing folder with the same name as the provided `module` name.
If no folder was found that means that it does not have any note data and hence it will create a
folder for that `module` and proceed to check on other `modules` in the `ModuleManager`. If the
specified `module` folder was found, it will proceed to load any `.txt` file within that folder as
note data for that `module`.

`Note data` is stored in such a format where the `name` of the `.txt`
file is the `name` of the note and the `contents` of the `.txt` file will be the data for
that `Note` object. For example, if a `module` has **5** `Note` objects in Terminus, it should
have **5** `text` files in its `module` folder.

These `.txt` files are then processed accordingly, checking whether if its **accessible**, **less
than 1MB** and **filename is a valid note name**. They are then loaded as `Note` object for
the `module`. For the rest that failed the criteria of a valid `Note` object, these files will then
be ignored.

Lastly, after `ModuleStorage` has loaded all content data for all `modules` in the ModuleManager, it
will return the `ModuleManager` back to `Terminus` for further operations.
